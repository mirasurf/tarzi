What is tarzi?
--------------

**Tarzi** is a unified search interface designed for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **agentic systems** built on large language models. Search is a core functionality in these systems, yet most search engine providers (SEPs) impose API paywalls or strict rate limits. **Tarzi**, empowered by browser automation and web crawling technologies, removes these barriers by supporting token-free queries across multiple search engines. With a single dependency, you can integrate and switch between different SEPs as neededâ€”seamlessly and efficiently.
