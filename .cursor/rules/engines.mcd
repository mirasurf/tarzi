Here is the definition and logics about search engines:
- Each engine provider can serve either webquery or apiquery, or both.
- The webquery mode always requires no api-key.
- The apiquery mode of some engines may require api-key.
- Here is a known engine list:

| Engine        | Web Query | API Query | API Key Required |
